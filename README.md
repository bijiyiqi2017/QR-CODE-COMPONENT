## My process

Read the requirements, then I tried to figure it out as I went along. I hope to develop a better process in the future.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code
- Determination ~ to complete what I set out to do (this challenge)

### What I learned

I came into this only knowing a handful of simple html tags.

Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and css was all new to me.

Something I really struggled with was box shadows. I discovered about box shadows while reading up on css card component. I got the hint from the challenge name and tried searching a few things.

Meta keywords I knew of long time ago. I also knew of a great website W3schools. I used the website to look up about viewport.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

I am happy that I can use css to style the two text separtely calling the element id like below.

```css
#text-1 {
  font-size: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #8a94a8;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}

#text-2 {
  font-size: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #1f3251;
  padding: 0.1rem 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

Just a few things I want to develop more understanding deeply.

- Flexbox
- Box Shadows
- CSS Units
- Git, & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- Dev Tools

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools ~ Box Shadows for Card Components](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This helped me to use a box shadow example. I really liked this one and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox Froggy Game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This was an entertaining way to learn/practice using flexbox code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
